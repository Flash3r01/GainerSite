<h2>The Gainerbot</h2>
<p>
    Sweating, grunting, never-sleeping.
    The Gainerbot is the first bigger project I started developing (as seen by the design decisions üçù).
    It is a bot for the popular voice, text and video messenger <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>.
    Its features include, but are not limited to, spamming the chat, insulting your friends, 
    consoring unacceptable words and playing audio.
    I want to mention the awesome <a href="https://github.com/eliaspr/DrachenlordBot">DrachenlordBot</a>, 
    that inspired me to write my own bot.
    The source code for the Gainerbot is also available on <a href="https://github.com/Flash3r01/GainerBot">GitHub</a>.
