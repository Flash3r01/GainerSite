        <h2>Gainersite</h2>
        <p>
            The Gainersite is a simple website that provides Information about me and what I do.
            Its development started because I wanted to familliarize myself with the basics of css, html and web development.
            Contrary to most websites nowadys the focus is on providing the content completely free and fast.
            The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Flash3r01/GainerSite/">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>The Gainerbot</h2>
        <p>
            Sweating, grunting, never-sleeping.
            The Gainerbot is the first bigger project I started developing (as seen by the design decisions üçù).
            It is a bot for the popular voice, text and video messenger <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>.
            Its features include, but are not limited to, spamming the chat, insulting your friends, 
            consoring unacceptable words and playing audio.
            I want to mention the awesome <a href="https://github.com/eliaspr/DrachenlordBot">DrachenlordBot</a>, 
            that inspired me to write my own bot.
            The source code for the Gainerbot is also available on <a href="https://github.com/Flash3r01/GainerBot">GitHub</a>.
